📊 Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to business insights visualization.
The goal is to analyze the dataset, clean and transform it, extract insights using SQL, and present results through an interactive Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a professional presentation created using Gamma.

This project showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, PostgreSQL/SQL Server, Power BI, and data storytelling, making it suitable for entry-level data analyst roles.

📁 Dataset
. Source: CSV / Excel file (local dataset)
. Type: Structured data
Contains:
. Numerical and categorical variables
. Missing values and duplicates
. Business-related metrics (e.g., sales, customers, transactions)
The dataset is loaded and processed using Python before being stored and queried in a SQL database.

🛠 Tools & Technologies 
. Programming Language: Python
. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 . Database: PostgreSQL / SQL Server
. SQL: Data querying and analysis
. Visualization: Power BI
. Presentation: Gamma
. Reporting: PDF / Document report
. Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading
Imported dataset into Python using Pandas

Performed initial inspection (shape, columns, data types)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
. Summary statistics
. Distribution analysis
. Correlation analysis
. Outlier detection
. Data visualization using charts and plots

3️⃣ Data Cleaning
. Handled missing values
. Removed duplicates
. Corrected data types
. Standardized column names
. Filtered irrelevant records

4️⃣ SQL Analysis
. Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / SQL Server
. Wrote SQL queries for:
. Aggregations
. Joins
. KPI calculations
. Trend analysis

5️⃣ Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
. Connected Power BI to SQL database
. Created interactive visuals:
. KPIs
. Bar, Line, and Pie charts
. Filters and slicers
. Designed a clean and business-friendly dashboard layout

6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation
. Created a structured analysis report
. Designed a professional presentation using Gamma
. Highlighted insights, trends, and recommendations

📊 Dashboard
. The Power BI dashboard provides:
. Key performance indicators (KPIs)
. Trend analysis over time
. Category-wise and region-wise breakdown
. Interactive filters for better decision-making

The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand business performance and key insights.

📈 Results & Insights
. Identified key trends and patterns in the data
. Highlighted top-performing and underperforming segments
. Improved data quality through cleaning
. Converted raw data into meaningful, actionable insights
